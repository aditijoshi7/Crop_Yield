# Crop_Yield
A ML model to predict Production of crop yields , on the basis of pattern recognition on the Crop_production dataset.
The data is stored in the csv file . 


# RandomForestRegressor

I have created a  Random Forest regressor to attain a MSE of 86 % on Training set and 72% on the test set , with a little HyperParameter tuning, although there is a lot of scope of improvement for increasing the accuracy over both the test set .


# XGBoost
The second model I Trained was XGBOOST Regressor and was able to attain approximately the same results.
